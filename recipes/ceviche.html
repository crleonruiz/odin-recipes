    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing you must do to prepare the easy Peruvian ceviche recipe is to squeeze the 12 lemons to extract their juice, reserve it for later. Then, cut the fish into pieces of approximately 3 centimeters. Place the pieces in the container you are going to use to serve the dish.</li>
            <li>Mix the fish with the chopped aji amarillo, the fish broth and the cilantro or culantro. Add the julienned onion and crushed garlic. Let it rest for a few minutes so that it marinates well and soaks up all the flavors.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste and place the boiled sweet potato, lettuce and boiled baby corn on one side of the plate.</li>
            <li>Then, pour the lime juice all over the plate so that it is well covered. Finally, cut a slice of red aji limo bell pepper and place it as decoration. Set aside in the refrigerator to cool, as this is a dish that is served cold. Peruvian ceviche is a dish that acts as an appetizer, so you can accompany it with rice with shrimp or a delicious salmon with shrimp sauce. Ready to eat!</li>
