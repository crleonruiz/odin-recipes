    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza is one of the most iconic dishes of Italian cuisine, loved and enjoyed around the world for its versatility and delicious flavors. Originating from Naples, pizza has evolved into countless varieties, making it impossible to declare a single version as the definitive one. However, this time, we bring you a recipe inspired by the traditional Neapolitan pizza, focusing on its classic aspects: a thin, crispy crust, a rich tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil leaves.
        Many people enjoy pizza as a meal in itself, but it can also be paired with sides like a fresh Caesar salad, garlic knots, or even a refreshing drink for the perfect balance of flavors.</p>
